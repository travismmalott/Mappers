Mappers is a web application created during my time with Microsoft's MSTA code camp, it was my capstone project. 
MAPPERS main goal is to make receiving orders in a new place as easy as possible for all United Statesâ€™ military families on the move. 
It is built upon ASP.NET Core 3.1 utilizing model view controller technology and published through Azure web services. 
Primary languages include C#, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and T-SQL. 
The current implementation uses an Azure SQL database as the backend repository of information so that an admin can manage the information from any machine that has internet connection. 
Third party services used for collaboration purposes include Github and Git.
